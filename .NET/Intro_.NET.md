"Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for this opportunity. My name is Vraj Clerk, and I'm currently in the final semester of my IT degree. Over the course of my academic journey, I've developed a deep interest in software development, especially in backend technologies, which is why I am particularly drawn to .NET development.

Beyond what’s listed on my resume, I’d like to highlight my enthusiasm for continuous learning. Recently, I've been diving into C# to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming and how it applies to enterprise-level solutions in .NET. I've also worked on projects involving ASP.NET, where I implemented web services and worked on building dynamic applications.

Additionally, I am passionate about problem-solving, which I have further developed while preparing for technical interviews, working on coding challenges, and enhancing my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

I am excited to contribute my skills as a fresher while continuing to learn and grow in this role. I'm particularly eager to leverage the power of .NET to build scalable and efficient applications. Looking forward to discussing how I can bring value to your team."

This introduction highlights your motivation, recent learning efforts, and enthusiasm for .NET development beyond your resume. Let me know if you'd like to refine any specific part!
