<br>

## 10. What is Amazon S3 and how is it used in DevOps?
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It offers high durability, availability, and security.

In DevOps, S3 is used for:

- `Artifact Storage`: Storing build artifacts, binaries, and deployment packages.
- `Backup and Recovery`: Keeping backups of important data and configurations.
- `Logging`: Storing logs from applications and infrastructure for analysis and monitoring.
- `Static Website Hosting`: Hosting static assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `CI/CD Pipelines`: Integrating with services like CodePipeline and CodeBuild to store intermediate and final artifacts.

<br>

## 12. What is AWS Lambda and how does it support DevOps practices?
- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply upload your code, and Lambda handles the execution, scaling, and availability.

### Used for:
- Building scalable and independent services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately.
- Automation
- Cost Efficiency : pay per use

<br>

## 14. What is AWS IAM and why is it important in DevOps?
- AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users, groups, and roles, and define permissions to allow or deny access to AWS resources.

### Importance in DevOps:

- `Security`: Ensures that only authorized individuals and services can access specific resources, following the principle of least privilege.
- `Automation`: Use IAM roles to grant permissions to automated processes, such as CI/CD pipelines, without embedding credentials in code.
