# Docker 

## 1. What is Container?
```
- Docker container is lightweight ,standalone and executable package that includes everything needed to run a software including code,libraries, runtime, system tools and settings etc..

- docker containers consist of applications and all their
 dependencies.They share the kernel and system resources with other containers and run asisolated systems in the host operating system.

- Containers are created from images, which are essentially templates that define the environment and settings for a container.

### Key Features:
>- **Lightweight**: Containers are much lighter than virtual machines, as they share the host operating system.
  
>- **Isolation** : Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, helps prevent conflicts between different software versions and dependencies.

>- **Scalability and Modularity**: Applications can be broken down into smaller, manageable microservices, each running in its own container. This modularity simplifies scaling specific parts of an application independently based on demand.

>- **portability** 

### Use Cases :
>1. **Development and Testing**: 
Containers provide a consistent and reliable environment for developers to work in, ensuring.

> 2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
Automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications within containers to streamline the software release process.

## 2. Docker Container:
> Docker images are read-only templates that contain the instructions for creating a Docker container.

<br>

## 3. DockerFile

> It is a text file that has all commands which need to be run for building a given image.

<br>

## 4. Hypervisor

> A hypervisor plays a crucial role in enabling virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine. It helps improve resource utilization, flexibility, and isolation, making it indispensable in modern IT infrastructure, especially in data centers, cloud environments, and development environments.
