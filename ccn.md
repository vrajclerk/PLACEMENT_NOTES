## OSI Model

### What is the OSI model? Can you explain the function of each layer? 
A 7-layer architecture for network communication.

1. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw data bits over a physical medium.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Provides error detection and correction, and defines protocols for data transfer between devices on the same network (e.g., Ethernet).
3. **Network Layer**: Routes data between different networks (e.g., IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures complete data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats (e.g., encryption, compression).
7. **Application Layer**: End-user services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

## TCP vs UDP

### What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Connection-oriented, reliable, and ensures that all packets are received and ordered correctly.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Connectionless, faster but less reliable as it doesn’t guarantee packet delivery or order.

## DNS

### What is DNS and how does it work?

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It acts like the phonebook of the internet.

## IP Address

### What is an IP address? What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?

- **IP address**: A unique identifier for devices on a network.
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address, e.g., 192.168.1.1.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address, designed to overcome IPv4 exhaustion, e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334.

## Subnet Mask

### What is the purpose of a subnet mask?

- **Subnet mask**: Divides an IP address into a network and host portion. It helps determine the range of IP addresses within a particular network.

## DHCP

### What is DHCP and how does it work?

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, ensuring that each device has a unique IP.

## Web and PHP Networking

### What is the role of HTTP and HTTPS in web communication? How does HTTPS provide security?

- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol, used for transmitting data between web servers and clients.
- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP, uses SSL/TTLS encryption to secure data transmission, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

### What is a REST API, and how does it relate to networking in web applications?

- **REST API**: A style of web services where HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used for communication. It is stateless and allows web clients to interact with the server.

### What is the difference between GET and POST requests in HTTP?

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server. Parameters are visible in the URL.
- **POST**: Sends data to the server for processing. Parameters are sent in the body of the request, making it more secure for sensitive data.

### How can you handle file uploads in PHP securely over the network?

- Use PHP’s `move_uploaded_file()` to store files securely.
- Validate file types and size.
- Rename files to prevent conflicts.
- Store them in directories not accessible publicly to prevent direct access.

### How would you manage CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a PHP application?

- Use appropriate headers in PHP, like:
    ```php
    header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
    header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS");
    ```
- Be cautious with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, allowing it only when necessary to prevent security risks.

## PHP and Network Communication

### How can you make an HTTP request in PHP? Can you demonstrate using cURL or file_get_contents?

- Using cURL:
    ```php
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    echo $response;
    ```
- Using `file_get_contents`:
    ```php
    $response = file_get_contents("http://example.com");
    echo $response;
    ```

### What are the common pitfalls when handling network timeouts and retries in PHP?

- Ensure appropriate timeout settings with `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30);` to avoid hanging requests.
- Use retry mechanisms for transient failures (e.g., retry a few times before failing).
- Log failures for debugging.

### How do sessions work in PHP, and how are they transmitted between the client and server?

- Sessions are stored on the server, and a unique session ID is sent to the client via cookies. The client sends this session ID with each request, allowing the server to associate the request with the correct session.

### How can you prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in PHP applications?

- **XSS**: Sanitize user input using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
- **CSRF**: Implement CSRF tokens in forms, ensuring that each request is verified.

## Security and Networking

### What are some common network security issues in web development, and how can they be mitigated?

- **SQL Injection**: Use prepared statements with bound parameters.
- **XSS**: Sanitize user input.
- **CSRF**: Use CSRF tokens.
- **Data Theft**: Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.

### How do you implement secure file transfer in PHP (e.g., using FTP over SSL/TLS)?

- Use PHP’s `ftp_ssl_connect()` function to establish a secure FTP connection over SSL/TLS:
    ```php
    $ftp_conn = ftp_ssl_connect("ftp.example.com");
    ```

### What is SSL/TLS, and how would you implement SSL certificates in a PHP-based web application?

- **SSL/TLS**: Protocols that provide encryption for data transmitted over a network.
- To implement SSL in a PHP application:
    - Get an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).
    - Configure the web server (Apache or Nginx) to use SSL.
    - Ensure the application forces HTTPS connections.

## Advanced Networking

### What are WebSockets, and how can you implement them in a PHP application?

- **WebSockets**: A protocol that allows full-duplex communication between a client and server.
- In PHP, you can use libraries like Ratchet for WebSocket server implementation.

### How can PHP interact with a database over a network? What are some techniques to secure database communication?

- PHP interacts with a database over the network using MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., via drivers like PDO.
- To secure communication:
    - Use SSL to encrypt the connection.
    - Restrict database access based on IP addresses.
    - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### What is load balancing, and how can you configure PHP applications to work in a load-balanced environment?

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.
- PHP applications can work in such environments by ensuring session persistence (e.g., using shared storage for sessions) and using a shared database.
